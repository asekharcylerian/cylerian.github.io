This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdiction) which would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Florida.</p>
            <p>(d)	<u>Submission to Jurisdiction</u>.

Each of the parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form.</p>
            <p>(e)	<u>Waiver of Jury Trial</u>.  WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUIT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, OR CHALLENGE TO THE  ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER EXIST WITH REGARD TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, OR OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

            <p>(f)	<u>Attorneys’ Fees</u>.  In any suit, action, or proceeding to enforce, interpret, or challenge the enforceability of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such suit, action, or proceeding shall be entitled, in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, to its reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and all other costs of litigation or other action, through all appeals.</p>

            <p>(h)	<u>Binding Effect; Assignment</u>.

            <p>(i)	<u>Third-Party Beneficiaries</u>.  Except for the covenants and obligations provided in Section 12 (Limitation of Liability, which shall be for the benefit of and enforceable by those Persons specified therein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties (and their respective successors and permitted assigns), and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person, any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.</p>

All notices, requests, consents or other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (as elected by the party giving such notice) actually personally delivered with written acknowledgement of receipt, or delivered via Federal Express or other international overnight courier service, signature required or otherwise with such courier’s written confirmation of delivery, to the address provided in the introductory paragraph of this Agreement or to such other address as any party may designate by written notice complying with the terms of this Section.

            <p>(k)	<u>Non-Waiver</u>.

No waiver by either party of a default or breach or threatened default or breach of this Agreement by the other party shall be held or construed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach by such party.  The failure of either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to require at any time performance by the other party of any of the provisions hereof, shall in no way be construed to be a waiver or create an estoppel from enforcement of such provisions nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof, or the right of such party to thereafter enforce each and every such provision, or to seek relief as a result of the prior breach.  No waiver of any right or remedy available to a party hereto shall be binding on that party unless it is in writing and signed by that party.</p>

            <p>(m)	<u>Certain Equitable Remedies</u>.  Licensee acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by Licensee of any of its covenants and obligations under Section 8 (Intellectual Property Rights) of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm to Cylerian, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy.  Licensee agrees that, in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Licensee of any such covenants or obligations, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, Cylerian shall be entitled, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies which may be available to it in respect of such breach, to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that which be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without, to the extent provided by applicable law, any requirement to post bond).</p>
            <p>(n)	<u>Remedies Cumulative</u>.  Unless and then only to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative, each party shall have all rights and remedies provided by law or in equity, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent any party from seeking and recovering monetary or other damages sustained by such party as a result of any breach or violation of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.    </p>
            <p>(o)	<u>Force Majeure</u>.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither party will be liable in any respect under any theory of liability for any delay, default or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement otherwise, due to any cause beyond its reasonable control including acts of God, war, terrorism, riot or riots, epidemics or pandemics (whether declared by the World Health Organization or otherwise), national or international declarations of emergency, embargos, strikes or walkouts or other industrial disputes, acts of civil or military authorities, government interference, denial or delays in processing of export license application, fire, floods, earthquakes, storms, or hurricanes; fuel crises, failure or interruption of electric power, telephone, fiber optic cable or the Internet or other communication connections or service (each a <strong>“Force Majeure”</strong>).</p>
            <p>(p)	<u>Entire Agreement</u>.  This Agreement, together with the Purchase Order, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by or on behalf of any party other than those set forth expressly in this Agreement.  </p>
            <p>(q)	<u>Counterparts</u>.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic or other transmission method; may bear signatures affixed through “.pdf” or other software including without limitation any electronic signature platform complying with the U.S. Federal ESIGN Act of 2000 (e.g., www.docusign.com), and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly executed and delivered and shall be valid and effective for all purposes.</p>
